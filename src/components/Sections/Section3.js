                        Blogr is a free and open source application backed by a
                        large community of helpful developers. It supports
                        features such as code syntax highlighting, RSS feeds,
                        social media integration, third-party commenting tools,
                        and works seamlessly with Google Analytics. The
                        architecture is clean and is relatively easy to learn.

                        deployment a breeze, but capable of producing even the
                        most complicated sites.
