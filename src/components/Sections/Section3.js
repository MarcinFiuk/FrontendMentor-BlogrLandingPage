                    Blogr is a free and open source application backed by a
                    large community of helpful developers. It supports features
                    such as code syntax highlighting, RSS feeds, social media
                    integration, third-party commenting tools, and works
                    seamlessly with Google Analytics. The architecture is clean
                    and is relatively easy to learn.
